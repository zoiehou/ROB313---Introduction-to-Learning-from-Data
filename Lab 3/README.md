ROB313 - Introduction to Learning from Data

Instructions of how the scripts should be run:
1. All the questions can be run with the 'main' function

2. Each question section of code is block commented by """
   (there are also subsections within questions, wrapped by
   separate """s).

3. By deleting the """ that wrap around each section or
   subsection, the results will display on the console in a 
   readable format
   
4. After the code has run, required plots will be saved in 
   the directory that the python file is running at (as well
   as display on the console)
   
Note: the data_utils.py file and all neccessary libraries 
      (the autograd library and other libraries that come
      with Jupyter Notebook) needs to be within the same 
      directory for the A3_code.py file to run properly as
      it imports and uses those libraries and files
