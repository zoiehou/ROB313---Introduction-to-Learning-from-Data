#ROB313 - Introduction to Learning from Data

Instructions of how the scripts should be run:
1. All the questions can be run with the 'main' function

2. Each question section of code is block commented by """
   at the start of the section and at the end of the section

3. By deleting the """ that wrap around each section, the
   results will display on the console in a readable format
   
4. After the code has run, required plots will be saved in 
   the directory that the python file is running at (as well
   as display on the console)
   
Note 1: the data_utils.py file and all neccessary libraries 
      (the scikit-learn library and other libraries that come
      with Jupyter Notebook) needs to be within the same 
      directory for the knn_alg.py file to run properly as
      it imports and uses those libraries and files

Note 2: The kNN_alg.ipynb should be ran by Jupyter Notebook, and the
	kNN_alg.py should be ran by Python.
